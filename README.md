This app was developed as a part of Chase Romano's Visual Analytics course (Spring 2022) in the UNC Charlotte Data Science and Business Analytics Program.

Data was sourced from the Movie Industry Dataset on Kaggle, which itself was ultimately scraped from IMDb via Python by the original analyst, Daniel Grijalva.
