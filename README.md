This app was developed as a part of Chase Romano's Visual Analytics course (Spring 2022) in the UNC Charlotte Data Science and Business Analytics Program.

Data was sourced from the [Movie Industry Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies), which itself was ultimately scraped from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) via Python by the original analyst, Daniel Grijalva.
